## Stock Pattern Detector

Stock Pattern Detector is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of significant price changes based on volume patterns recognized several days before the price movement. The system focuses on analyzing 50-100 companies from a selected sector, where heterogeneity is minimized due to the sector's more uniform business models, allowing for better prediction accuracy.
